% Since most competitions are online, and it's 2018, it seems silly to have X
% number of meetings be the deciding factor. On the other hand, that's what
% really shows dedication to the club. I decided to compromise. - DM

voting member:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The member has placed 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in a cybersecurity-focused
